# Discord WordReplacer Bot
A silly bot for Discord, that replaces random words when someone says something!

When someone in the channel says something, the bot rolls a number between 1-100.
If the roll returns true, it takes the phrase and replaces a random word in the phrase.

For example, in my server the random word is "butt" because I'm oh-so-mature.
Someone says "Hey, I'm new!" and the bot may replace this "Hey, I'm butt!"

That's really all there is to it. I hope someone will find this useful and maybe add it to their own bot!
